## Introduction

Julia, is a FREE programming language...which can be downloade from here...

https://www.julialang.org/downloads/   

It's very quick and easy to set up to run inside of Window 10 Pro.   

1> You just download the appropriate file: Windows 64 bit installer/-etc.  
2> Then, you left double click on the set up file after it's finished downloading  
3> Next, you will be offered 3 options...run Julia/show folder/show docs...I selected all 3 of these.  

...moving over to the black screen DOS window I typed in my first line of Julia code...  
>> julia>println("Hello, world!")  
>> julia>Hello, world!

...as simple, straight forwards, and, quick as that! ;-)

Mind you, I'm still a 'beginner' working on learning all of the basics.  

**NOTE:** The file extension for julia program code file is: [.jl]
