## Introduction

Julia, is a FREE programming language...which can be downloaded from here...

https://www.julialang.org/downloads/   

It's very quick and easy to set up to run inside of Window 10 Pro.   

1> You just download the appropriate file: Windows 64 bit installer/-etc.  
2> Then, you left double click on the set up file after it's finished downloading  
3> Next, you will be offered 3 options...run Julia/show folder/show docs...I selected all 3 of these.  

...moving over to the black screen DOS window I typed in my first line of Julia code...    
>> julia>println("Hello, world!")    
>> julia>Hello, world!  

>> julia>  

...as simple, straight forwards, and, quick as that! ;-)

Mind you, I'm still a 'beginner' working on learning all of the basics.

## NOTES

**NOTE(1):** When initially setting up the Julia program...make sure to check include in PATH...;   
             otherwise, Windows will NOT be able to find the program  
             when you try running it through DOS   
             by typing in the keyword:   

>>C:\>julia    
             
**NOTE(2):** The file extension for julia program code file is: [.jl];    
             do NOT try saving the file as being called: [.jl.txt]...;   
             ...as Julia does NOT understand how to read plain [.txt] files?!  
             You might need to save the Notepad file...  
             by, deliberately, stating save as: All Files/  
             as opposed to the default saving method which is: [.txt].   
             
             Example of how to run Julia program files: [.jl] through using a DOS prompt...  
             
>>C:\>julia test01.jl  

...the DOS command prompt should be pointed to the same directory folder where the file called: [test01.jl] lives...;      
otherwise, DOS *cannot* find where the program file is...in order to run it, effectively...?!    
  

**NOTE(3):** At the current date: *Wed 15th Sep 2021* I seem to have downloaded Julia version: 1.6.2      

>>C:\>julia -ver

## Example Julia program codes...

### Julia Maths operators...

>>println("3 + 3 = ",3+3)  
>>println("3 - 3 = ",3-3)  
>>println("3 * 3 = ",3*3)  
>>println("3 / 3 = ",3/3)  
>>println("3 % 2 = ",3%2)  
>>println("3 ^ 3 = ",3^3)  

>># output...  

>># 3 + 3 = 6  
>># 3 - 3 = 0  
>># 3 * 3 = 9  
>># 3 / 3 = 1.0  
>># 3 % 2 = 1  
>># 3 ^ 3 = 27
