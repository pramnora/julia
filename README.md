# julia
Julia code repository

Julia, is a FREE programming language which I really like using; though, I honestly must admit, I'm not entirely familiar with all of its commands, yet; but, I'm sure that my understand is very highly likely to improve over time.

The file extension for julia program codes is: [.jl]
